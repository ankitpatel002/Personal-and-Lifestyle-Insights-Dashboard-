# Personal-and-Lifestyle-Insights-Dashboard-

I'm thrilled to share my latest Power BI project—a three-page dashboard that delves deep into personal and lifestyle factors influencing health and well-being!

This dashboard was designed to provide comprehensive insights into attendees' behaviors, habits, and demographics, offering a unique perspective on critical lifestyle aspects.

-> Key Metrics (KPIs):
Total Attendees: Understanding the size of the population analyzed.
Average Income: Gaining insights into financial aspects of attendees.
Average Age: Highlighting age-based trends in lifestyle choices.

-> Visuals Across 2 Pages:
8 Donut Charts: Exploring Total Attendees by Alcohol Consumption, Smoking Status, Physical Activity Level, Family History of Depression, Employment Status, Dietary Habits, Chronic Medical Conditions, and Mental Illness.

1 Funnel Chart: Analyzing Total Attendees by Sleep Patterns.
1 Line Chart: Visualizing Total Attendees by Age Groups.
1 Ribbon Chart: Depicting Total Attendees by Education Level.
1 Treemap: Examining Total Attendees by Marital Status.

-> Technical Highlights:
Data sourced from Kaggle, transformed, and visualized in Power BI.
Utilized advanced Power BI features like slicers, multi-page formatting, and diverse chart types to ensure clarity and depth.
